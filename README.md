### Notes:

1. I am using Cocoapods in order to use the Kingfisher library for downloading images asynchronously from the web: https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher .  This is the ONLY third party library I am using in this project.  

2. I purposely did not include any comments in the project because I honestly felt it is self-explanatory.  However, I will be more than happy to discuss my project in person in the near future.

3. The general architecture that I used for this project is MVC-N.

4. I am not using storyboards or xib files in the project.  I did everything in Swift, including the use of Auto Layout.

Please do let me know if you have any questions!
